  👋 Hi there! My name is Tara. I'm a double major graduate student at Georgia Tech and a data governance analyst at MARTA.
  <br><br>
  👩🏻‍💻 I’m a team player with a strong interest in data. I developed my passion for technology when I discovered how big data can transform transit systems. Since then, I've pursued this interest with the help of programs like Rewriting the Code.
  
  👤 Along with my passion for technology, I've developed a strong desire to contribute to social good throughout my life. I enjoy using technology to generate insights that can improve urban mobility, women's rights, inequality, and public health.
  <br><br>
  ✨ I'm currently focused on machine learning, geo-spatial data science & engineering, and GIS.
  
  🛠 Here's What I'm Working on Right Now:
  
  📚Volunteering at Chayn, an NGO that helps women experiencing abuse find the information and support they need to regain control of their lives.
  
  📚Actively participating in CTF (cybersecurity competitions).
